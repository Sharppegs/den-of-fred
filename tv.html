            Adam West
        </figure>
        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="lead">Last week I had just returned from an exhausting yet exhilarating bike ride in the Andalusian heat to see that Adam West, for many the first and most iconic Batman had passed away, aged 88. 
                Although not in the same league as the devastating recent news stories that have come from Britain in the past month, 
                seeing the news still had an effect on me, albeit for different reasons. It represented the end of an era.</p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">
                    <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/west1.jpg">
                    Adam West as Batman
                </figure>
            <p>Needless to say, I didn’t know nor had ever met Adam West, but I am one of multiple millions for whom Adam West was their first cultural ‘hero’. While I was not alive in the 1960s to see the cultural impact 
                the series had first hand, I was at least around to see it’s second wave of popularity during the late 80s and early 90s, when the series was repeated in response to the furore and excited anticipation that 
                surrounded the upcoming release of Tim Burton’s 1989 film. In a life-defining moment, my parents had taped a Channel 4 screening of “Batman: The Movie” in 1988, and made the blessed decision that it was something 
                that my 3-year-old self might enjoy. Oh how well they knew me.</p>
                <p>In the years that followed, I watched that tape so many times that not only did I know practically every word of dialogue from the film itself by heart, but even the adverts that interrupted it (such as this beauty from Ariel, 
                    featuring the colourful cockney Mrs B and her droopy tenant Mr H). From the moment I could talk, I was a Batfan, not to mention an expert over the benefits of choosing Ariel and Oil of Ulay (later ‘Olay’) instead of other leading brands.</p>
            <figure class="individual-article-images">
                <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/west2.jpg">
                His Colourful Foes
            </figure>
            <p>A big part of the reason why is because Batman was a series perfect for young children – the colours the bright, the action was plentiful and the characters were unforgettable. The casting of the key players and the most popular super villains was 
                note perfect – in particular Cesar Romero as the Joker who somehow made the leap from his trademark suave Latin lover persona to an ADHD-riddled hyena in clown makeup almost without effort. But in the middle of all the zany madness was West as Batman, 
                the cool as a cucumber protagonist our young minds instantly knew it would be wise to get behind – he was the respected parent in a world of the naughtiest of children. For lack of a better word, the straight man. </p>
            <p>It wouldn’t be until much later when I, like many others, revisited the series at an older age and saw the true comedic genius in his performances – something that completely went over my head as a youngster. In short, the reason why the series was 
                just as enjoyable for adults.</p>
            <p>The beauty of it was in the tone. It is my belief that one of the key reasons why Monty Python became such a big hit all over the world was the way in they (In particular John Cleese and Graham Chapman) could say the most the most ridiculous things in the most sensible manner. 
                It messes with our minds – you expect one thing yet hear another. As a comedic device it’s timeless, while others come and go according to tastes and fashions of the era. Chris Morris was able to take it several steps further in the 1990s with The Day Today and Brasseye, 
                able of getting the public and celebrities alike to believe practically anything he said, no matter how ridiculous, purely due to deadly serious way he was able to say it. However, before them all, there was Adam West.</p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">
                    <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/west3.jpg">
                    With Burt Ward as Robin
                </figure>
            <p>Few could speak lines such as “True. You owe your life to dental hygiene” or “In future, be more careful from who you accept free lemonade.” with the utmost sincerity as he was able to do. His school-master tone could convince anybody that his words were gospel irrespective of what they were, 
                and I suspect is a big reason as to why the series has stood the test of time. Even after the groovy pop-art atheistic of which the series revolution began to look dated, the comic gold of West’s delivery remained as fresh as ever.</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, Adam West’s Batman was the first and best of my childhood heroes. One tragedy of getting older is the fact that these heroes inevitably begin to pass away, cutting another tie with your youth as you move further and further away from it. With adulthood, for better or worse, 
                comes a lot of unpredictability and instability, so it can be a nice thought that at least some consistencies remain. For me, Adam West was one such consistency – being that I still watch and love the Batman TV series, he’d been a part of my life for just shy of 30 years and I simply liked the idea that he was still around. </p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">
                    <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/west4.jpg">
                    West, Ward and Julie Newmar at ComicCon
                </figure>
            <p>Better yet, he wasn’t just a relic. In recent years, he has won over a new legion of younger fans due to his appearances as the deranged “Mayor Adam West” in Family Guy – easily one of the series’ more popular characters, based on the sheer number of compilation videos on youtube alone. 
                For me, his “This is my Jam” scene in the drycleaner kills me every time.</p>
            <p>As for the Batman series, Adam West is now added to the extensive list of main players that are now sadly no longer with us. All that really remains now is Burt Ward and Julie Newmar, better known to I suspect even their friends and family as Robin and Catwoman. While I have absolutely nothing against Newmar, 
                I’m actually one of those who prefers Lee Meriwether’s slightly more sensitive portrayal of Catwoman, when she replaced Newmar in the film due to scheduling conflicts (Meriwether, incidentally also still with us, on twitter and somehow still gorgeous at the age of 82).</p>
            <p>As for Burt Ward, for me he’s always come across as a bit of a wally and is known to lie extensively about his experience as Robin (See here for his baffling claim that he was suspended in the air over a real pit of tigers when all evidence points to the contrary). Neither, with the possible exception of Meriwether 
                (first crush after all) can hold a candle to Adam West. But then again, not many could.</p>
            <p>Rest in Peace, Caped Crusader.</p>

            Our Lord

        <div class="article-content">
            <p class="lead">I love Lorraine Kelly. Much like Alex Ferguson and my perpetual feelings of self shame, Lorraine has always just been there. She is a sturdy backbone in a rapidly evolving society where, if the Tories are to be believed, 
                everyone is now an entrepreneur or small business owner.</p>
            <p>I am not an entrepreneur. I can’t even spell entrepreneur without the aid of trusty old spellcheck – and even that has trouble, offering only ‘entrapment’ as an alternative when I right click on my red, 
                underlined monstrosity of an attempt. I don’t own a business and I have not at any point applied to be on ‘The Apprentice’ so am therefore, in these times of ill-advised austerity, a failure. 
                Even Paris Hilton calls herself a ‘businesswoman’ these days. And although I still harbour my doubts about that, what is clear is that I have failed to follow this decade’s golden rule – that life equals profit, and everyone else can go fuck themselves.</p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">
                    <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/lorraine2.jpg">
                </figure>
            <p>But despite now being an arduous drain on society, I can count on Lorraine to never pour scorn on me. On the contrary, Lorraine has made a career of telling those of us who are now able to watch television between 8:30 and 9:30am on a weekday not to worry about anything 
                and that it will all be just super in the end. She offers a slice of morning comfort before Jeremy Kyle begins his daily dose of incessant screaming at the poor.</p>
            <p>A typical showing of “Lorraine” begins with a morning paper review, alongside two guests from the world of broadcast journalism. These can range from the New Statesmen’s political editor Medhi Hassan to ‘Celebrity Love Island Extra’ host Mark Durden Smith. 
                With this being Lorraine rather than Newsnight, the paper review is usually made up of a ratio permitting one story covering the main political issue of the day to three about the perils of childcare, Jennifer Aniston or whatever rubbish study Mumsnet have orchestrated.
                Arguments are generally kept to a minimum and conclusions always fall in to the categories of “isn’t that nice” or “oh dear”. It is the most upbeat and smiley newspaper review on television, even if faced with a major natural disaster or a new government proposal to 
                introduce extra tax breaks for cabinet ministers.</p>
            <figure class="individual-article-images">
                <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/lorraine7.jpg">
            </figure>
            <p>After the obligatory “ring us to share your worthless opinion on today’s stories” piece, Lorraine asks if I would like £30,000. Before I can say “yes please, thanks Lorraine!”, a forgotten star from TVs golden past (Tim Vincent! Jenny Powell!) is on screen wondering around 
                a swimming pool and telling me what I could do with the money Lorraine has just kindly offered. Sadly though, just as I think my day couldn’t get any better, it transpires that I need to answer a devious brainteaser before Lorraine will let me claim her gift. 
                The show swiftly moves on from there as I tear my hair out; Lorraine knowing full well that I will never know whether “A big fuss over a small matter can be described as “A Storm in a…</p>
            <ol>
                <li>teacup</li>
                <li>hiccup</li>
                <li>buttercup</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are a couple of ‘real life’ story sections of the show, in which a person or persons is gently asked about a horrible thing that’s happened to them recently but it’s all ok because now “things are looking up”. This is of no interest to me, as I’m too busy deliberating over 
                whether I should ring in and have a stab at 3) Buttercup.</p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">
                    <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/lorraine3.jpg">
                    Flaunt that peak, Hayes
                </figure>
            <p>Now for the extrordinary widows peak of Mark Hayes, a fashion expert who on today’s show was brought on board to calm our fears about looking flabby on the beach, usually while surrounded by three or four skinny models. I have no doubt whatsoever that Mark Hayes knows his subject area very well, 
                but I find that I never listen to a word he says due to being hypnotised by his choice of haircut. As a male on the wrong side of 25, I’m often concerned by the rising temples that make up my hairline. However, Hayes seems to fully embrace his, embodying a style comparable to a shorn, hardened 
                Tintin that screams “Look at my massive widows peak!”.</p>
                <p>He also (much like myself) has a rather awkward stance when standing still, which he has to on a daily basis at the beginning of each episode, surrounded by pretty models as Lorraine informs us who this evil Tintin is and what the hell he’s doing there.</p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">
                    <img class="individual-article-image" src="tv/lorraine4.jpg">
                    Ross King
                </figure>
            <p>After Hayes, we may be treated to a bit of Ross King, who sits in front of a picture of the Hollywood hills and talks about the famous people he’s met that week. While this is sold as celebrity gossip, it is actually just a vehicle for King to tell those of us watching at home that he’s having a far nicer life than we are. 
                While some may consider that Lorraine is sticking the boot in at this point, I would argue that this is completely necessary. Lorraine is preparing us, if only slightly, for the foul and loud abuse Jeremy Kyle is mere minutes away from unleashing.</p> 
            <p>Ross King is an orange stop gap between the “be confident, fatty” mantra of Hayes, to the “Kill yourself right now you dumb piece of shit” philosophy of Kyle. Going directly from one to the other would provoke riots on our streets, and Lorraine Kelly, 
                with nearly 30 years of broadcasting experience under her belt, knows this all too well. </p>
                <figure class="individual-article-images">

                    The Jeremy Kyle riots of 2011 brought the country to it’s knees
                </figure>
            <p>And so concludes Lorraine for another day. As the closing theme music plays, I am left contemplating about how many beach towels I could have bought with the £30,000 offered earlier, or whether I could form a small business based around throwing bricks at Jeremy Kyle. As ever, she’ll be back tomorrow, fresh with 
                a new set of tips for looking acceptable on the beach and telling Posh Spice to cheer up a bit.</p>
            <p>When the sad day comes that “Lorraine” is to be no more, replaced by her inadequate Friday stand ins, they’ll be no need for hell. We’ll already be there.</p>
